GRETAA = Generalized Reconstruction of EDL Trajectory, Atmosphere, and Aerodynamics

This is a generalized framework to reconstruct entry, descent, and landing (EDL) parameters, such as trajectory, atmosphere, and aerodynamics. This tool has been demonstrated on the following EDL mission reconstructions:
1. Mars Pathfinder (1997)
2. Mars Exploration Rovers A and B (2004)
3. Mars Phoenix Lander (2008)
4. Mars Science Laboratory (2012)

Additionally, this tool has also been used for ballistic range test data.

The tool was developed 2008-present timeframe and will be updated to be useful
for future EDL missions.
